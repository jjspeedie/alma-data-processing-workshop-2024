<!--

0. What is ALMA: George's introductory slides (1 observatory, 4 world class facilities); NAASC support
  * Interferometery / visibilities / etc

1. Pipeline and CASA: Introduction to what CASA is (a few of Devaky intro slides)
  * What's new in pipeline, mention ALMA WSU is coming

2. Getting ALMA data: CARTA demo, in combination with the ALMA archive. Loading data from multiple programs.

3. Understanding your ALMA data: The Weblog? Typical issues, re-imaging using the pipeline...

4. Imaging data: Imaging; continuum and spectral line
* primary beam correction; masking; interactive/non-interactive; uvcontsub;

Lunch

5. Press with ALMA: Getting in the news/press releases

6. ALMA the easy way: SRDPs. AUDI. (Or: re-imaging using the pipeline...)

7. Getting the most out of your data: Self-cal, and Auto-selfcal

8. If time: Data combination

9. Wrap up: Opportunities, resources, feedback survey -->
