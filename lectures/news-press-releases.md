## News & Public Information

Is a part of a bigger communications. Science-focused version: Brian Kent (science newsletter).

Jill and co do: Plans & policies, news products, social media, press/media relations, communications training, CIP visits...

### News Products

What is a news product? It encases the different things that they share with the public. Includes: press releases, blogs, and announcements.

#### Press Releases

Translate a paper for the press and public. Make it make sense to the general public (concepts or metaphors).

We think about what will hook the press.

Besides writing the text, we also include original illustration or animation.

After the PR is put together, we distribute or share it on BOTH the NRAO public and science website. We also put it on newswire backend, which shares with journalists. Also send it directly to NRAO press contacts. Also, every now and then, this info might be part of a press conference.

##### News Request Form

When submitted a paper, then is the time to reach out to Jill and fill one of these forms out.

#### Blog

A blog can be written by someone like you! Any length, any staff member, can include a visual of any kind, will be distributed on NRAO public website and social media. Nice thing you can link to / point to from your own website/CV/etc. It's a lot more flexible in terms of scheduling. Here there's no pressure, and doesn't have to focus on something you're about to publish; there's a lot of creativity you can bring in.

It's just about getting the story out there in the public. This gets thrown into the mix throughout the year. It's an opportunity to share creativity.

#### Announcements

We do these a lot - not as in depth as a press release and not as personal as a blog. It's like "come to the Jansky lecture" or "Welcome to class of 2024".

#### Social Media

Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIN, Youtube -- and coming soon: new Media Ambassador program.

Media Ambassador program: Not just scientific but also have a lot of fun, being contemporary. Rolling this program out in the next month to 6 weeks.

LinkedIN has been growing a lot over the last year.

### Press/Media Relations

Requests from press/media requests - get 150 of those per year. Requests for fact checking, image use, broadcast news, documentaries, textbooks, etc.

See the "media use" policy in the footer of the public website. Good to grab basically anything made by NRAO so long as you credit them.

### Communications Training

We don't have a big official training for everyone all at once, we do it by project or by staff request. Help shape the delivery of the content. Done to help prepare people for interviews, shoots, etc.


### Resources

* NRAO brand. We have a brand like any other company. The Powerpoint template is part of that brand. Actually kind of required, being funded by NSF and AUI (associated universities incorporated).

* Logo

from the Cycle 11 Proposerâ€™s Guide:
6.4 Opportunities for public promotion of ALMA
If a PI believes their results are newsworthy or of interest to a broader community, the PI should contact the ALMA Education and Public Outreach (EPO) team to develop materials for presentation to the media and the public (e.g., press releases), including support in the preparation of visuals, if relevant. EPO may ask for cooperation on the scientific content and for the PI to be available for possible interviews. The e-mail address for the ALMA EPO team is alma-iepot@alma.cl.
